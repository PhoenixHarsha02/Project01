                <p>De Villiers began his international career as <i>a wicket-keeper-batsman</i>, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, De Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper.

            <div>
                <h2 >HTML </h2>
                <p>(HyperText Markup Language) is the most <b>basic building block of the Web</b>. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
                "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>HTML ELEMENTS</h2>
                <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as head, title, body, header, footer, article, section, p, div, span, img, aside, audio, canvas, datalist, details, embed, nav, output, progress, video, ul, ol, li and many others.
                    An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by tags.  The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the title tag can be written as Title, TITLE, or in any other way.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>HTML IMAGES</h2>
                <p>In the beginning, the Web was just text, and it was really quite boring. Fortunately, it wasn't too long before the ability to embed images (and other more interesting types of content) inside web pages was added. There are other types of multimedia to consider, but it is logical to start with the humble img element, used to embed a simple image in a webpage.
                        What exactly should you write inside your alt attribute? It depends on why the image is there in the first place. In other words, what you lose if your image doesn't show up:
                        <ul>    Decoration. You should use CSS background images for decorative images, but if you must use HTML, add a blank alt="". If the image isn't part of the content, a screen reader shouldn't waste time reading it.</ul>
                        <ul>     Content. If your image provides significant information, provide the same information in a brief alt text – or even better, in the main text which everybody can see. Don't write redundant alt text. How annoying would it be for a sighted user if all paragraphs were written twice in the main content? If the image is described adequately by the main text body, you can just use alt="".</ul>
                        <ul>    Link. If you put an image inside a tags, to turn an image into a link, you still must provide accessible link text. In such cases you may, either, write it inside the same a element, or inside the image's alt attribute – whichever works best in your case.</ul>
                        <ul>    Text. You should not put your text into images. If your main heading needs a drop shadow, for example, use CSS for that rather than putting the text into an image. However, If you really can't avoid doing this, you should supply the text inside the alt attribute.</ul>
